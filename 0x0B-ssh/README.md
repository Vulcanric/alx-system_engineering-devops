# 0x0B. SSH
**`DevOps`** **`SSH`** **`Network`** **`SysAdmin`** **`Security`**

## Description
This project is the second project of the DevOps and System Administration project series I did to get myself ready for a career of a DevOps engineer. The first was [0x0A-configuration_management](https://github.com/Vulcanric/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x0A-configuration_management) where I configured a client server using **Puppet**.<br><br>This project is done to obtain a deep understanding of the **Secure Shell (SSH)** Communication Protocol and its functionalites, such as.
- Provision of a secure communication as it encrypts traffic (intense security).
- Uses port 22, etc.

This project contains Bash scripts and Puppet Manifests that are used to communicate to a remote server via the SSH Client.
