# 0x0D. Web stack debugging #0
**`DevOps`**	**`SysAdmin`**	**`Scripting`**	**`Debugging`**

This is the **first** part of the Webstack debugging series.

## Concept
The Webstack debugging series is a collection of projects I did to train myself in the art of debugging.
In this debugging series, I was given broken/bugged webstacks. The goal is for me to come up with Bash scripts that once executed, will bring the webstack to a working state.

## My solution
The above Bash script will resolve the problem and bring the webstack to a working state, once executed.
