# Networking Basics
Introduction to networking and how data and information is being transmitted over the Internet.
## Concepts
#### TCP and UDP
#### LAN and WAN
#### ping/ICMP(Internet Control Message Protocol)
#### The Open System Internationale (OSI) model:
	The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes communication functions of telecommunication devices without regard to their internal underlying structure.

This model's major aim is to segregate the functionalities of communication layers for easy understanding of networking.
#### The seven layers
According to this model, there are seven (7) layers of communication arranged in order of advancement; From the most primitive to the most advanced with each layer interacting to the layer below as well as above it, they are:
1. Physical - The transfer of bits through electrical impulses, light or radio signals.
2. Data link - In this layer, data frames are transferred through the Physical layer, e.g. Ethernet, LAN.
3. Network - Involves routing of data packets to the right computer address. This is done by a router.
4. Transport - Data is being transported via a protocol (TCP or UDP) and IP suit and encoded at end point.
5. Session - Involves maintaining a communication stream. E.g. Establishing a secure connection.
6. Presentation - Involves presenting the data in the right format. e.g. jpeg, mpeg, text, e.t.c.
7. Application - The most advanced layer, involves using services like http, https, ftp.
